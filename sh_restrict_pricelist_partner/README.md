About
============
Currently in odoo customers can access all pricelists by default. So this module restricts pricelists for the customer. This module displays the selected pricelists to the customer. You need to go inside the particular customer and select the pricelist, which pricelist you want to visible. if you don't give any pricelist than all pricelist will be accessible/visible. wherever the pricelist field of view it will affect all those fields. Cheers!

3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
